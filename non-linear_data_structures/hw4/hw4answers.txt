Answers to 2B below:

1: O(N), worst case is traversing all blocks to find the index
2: O(N), similar to above. may need to shift all elements after insertion point.
3: O(N), similar to insertion except shifting after removal point.
4: O(N) still, worst case is maybe traversing all blocks to find the index

2C below:
Storing stuff in blocks means that it is more memory-efficient than a singly linked
list, no individual nodes everywhere.
Probably takes a lot of process to move and shift elements when inserting/removing.

2D below:
Constant block size means we have a good idea of what memory usage will look like.
If blocks aren't fully utilized, wasted memory vs a dynamic array which will not
have that problem.
